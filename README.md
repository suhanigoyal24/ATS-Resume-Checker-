📌 Project Overview

Recruitment teams receive hundreds of resumes per job posting making manual screening
slow, inconsistent and prone to bias. This system uses AI/ML to automate resume parsing,
skill extraction, and candidate ranking.

HR teams can upload up to 20 resumes at once, match them against a job description,
and receive ranked results , cutting screening time by ~70% while improving accuracy
and consistency.
